# Programming-languages

1) The types defined in our language: SOL, SET, VAL and other functions.
SOL - a language that we defined as, among other things, 3 operations: cutting, merging and multiplying by scalar. We also defined global and static and a Boolean variable.
SET - A list of numbers.
ENV - This is a new environment we defined (we also saw it in class). Within it we defined VAL and different types of builders (especially Boolean)

2) I used this code snippet in call-static because we do not want to change the values but only know what their values are

3) In the first, second functions we preferred to use call-static because we only want to know the values and not change them.
In the cons function we preferred to use call-dynamic because we wanted to allow the list to change if necessary.

4)The test will pass, even though in practice it is not supposed to work.
